Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

it a way of designing,building, testing,and maintaining software.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Reliability_ It ensure software performs as expected without bias.
 2.scalability and flexibility_Ensure that the system can handle and increase load without affecting  performance.
3.Efficiency_Helps to optimizer developer workforce while maintaining high quality standards.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement_It gather the documents user needs and system requirements.
2.Design_Creating high-level and detailed designs of the Software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation_ It is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.watefall is a step-by -step process ,while Agilecis flexible and changes as needed.
2.Waterfall follows fixed phases,but Agile works in short cycles.
3.Watefalls has little customer input after planning, but Agile involved customers throughout.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Intergrated Development Environments (ides)why they matter :make coding easier with auto-complete and debugging tools.

Examples pycharm-Great for python vs code -support many languages  Eclise
2.Version control system (vcs) why they matter:track changes in code and allow rollback.





What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
keeping up with new tech the struggle:New frameworks ,language, and tools pop up all the time.
Meeting deadlines the struggle  juggling multiple task while racing against the clock can be stressful.

Working with a team the struggle:Merging code ,resolving, and staying on the same page isn't always easy.




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.Integration testing-It checking how parts work together what it is:making sure different pieces of the program works properly when connected.
2.System testing-Testing the whole application what it is running the entire program to see if everything works properly.
3.Acceptance- Making sure its ready for users what it is:letting real users test the app before launching it.
4.Unit testing-Testing small pieces of code .What it is:checking if a small part of the code like a function or a button,work correctly 
 









#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the ability of machine to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
importance 
1.Enhances Al performance _It reduces ambiguous.
2.Increase efficiency_ It saves time by increasing time on high-quality content.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
wrong Â«Tell me about cars"(Too broad-what about them?)Improved prompt:right "How do electric cars work,and how are they better than gas cars?"why is better 

1.More specific-Focuses on electric cars not all cars.
2.Clear question _Ask for both how they work and a comparison.
3.Easier to answer _A)know exactly what information to give.
